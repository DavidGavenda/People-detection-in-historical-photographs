Master thesis on topic of People detection in historical photographs

# Project Overview

Currently, rapid advancements in the field of computer vision and deep learning are leading to significant progress in the detection of objects in images. Current models achieve excellent results across a broad spectrum of benchmark databases. However, the success of these models can be limited when applied to lower-quality photos, such as digitized historical photographs.

This work focuses on exploring the possibilities of using modern computer vision methods for object detection, specifically people, in historical photographs. The aim is to determine how current models handle such a task and identify opportunities for improving their performance in this particularly challenging task.

The theoretical part is dedicated to studying the issues of people detection using deep learning methods, encompassing the exploration of current approaches, techniques, and models used in object detection. This part of the work will include the theoretical foundations of machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.

## Practical Part

In the practical part, we are engaged in:

- Identifying and creating a suitable database of labeled digitized historical photographs, which serves as the basis for training and testing models. For this purpose, we used our own set of historical photos, obtained from the Fortepan collection and photographs from the life of Milan Rastislav Štefánik. We labeled these photos using the CVAT tool so that we could use our own photo database for training models and testing their success. The work will also be devoted to the analysis of the quality and characteristics of such a dataset.
- Verifying existing solutions for the given problem, including testing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the selected database. This part of the work will focus on a wide range of models, such as Haar Cascade, HOG, R-CNN, SSD, Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet, MobileNet, CenterNet, EfficientDet, and YOLO. It will also pay attention to the latest versions of these models, such as YOLOv7 and YOLOv8.
- Testing existing models on the obtained dataset is also part of the work. This part includes the evaluation of models, analysis of single-stage and two-stage models, as well as the examination of problematic photos, on which the models may struggle with object detection. Various models, such as YOLO models, single-stage models (e.g., SSD), and two-stage models (e.g., R-CNN), will be examined within the testing.
- Finally, the work will include an analysis of the obtained results, identification of areas where there are possibilities for improving the performance of current models for detecting people in historical photographs, and a discussion about possible next steps and research directions in this field.

## Project Aim

The main aim of this work is to explore the possibilities of using modern methods and models of computer vision for object detection, specifically people, in historical photographs. The work focuses on testing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on digitized historical photographs and analyzing their performance in this particularly challenging task, to find out how current models handle such a task and identify opportunities for improving their results in this area.

This work will provide a detailed overview and analysis of current methods and models used in the field of computer vision and deep learning for object detection, focusing on the detection of people in historical photographs. The results of this work will contribute to a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of current approaches, as well as the identification of potential opportunities for improving the detection of people in digitized historical photographs.
